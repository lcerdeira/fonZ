# fonZ

fonZ 
searches among the installed fonts  
and let the user choose  
among those found  
which one to use  
for the website  

### html css javascript

fonZ for now has 4 files  
1 html example page with css embedded for the page and fonZ  
2 js one for fonZ application and the other for a list of fonts - only the name  
1 image svg optional for the background  

## Usage
download the files and put the scripts in a folder named js  
and the image in his img folder  
or use other names or locations and change the links in the example page  
or
download and unzip the zip file
open the example page in a browser and run the script  

fonZ can run in any location with or without a webserver  
without server fonZ loss some functions and the user cannot save his choice  
because fonZ need some cookie for stored the name of fonts found  
if it find something  


## Usage without the example page
put the code at bottom of example page in your page  
put the css code of fonZ in a css file or embedd it  
link the scripts  
done


## Add other name fonts
add the names to the script for fonts where are stored the existing fonts and in the same format i.e. 'a fonts','another','serif','etc etc',  
for now fonZ support until 324 fonts  
but is quite simple enlarge that limit
